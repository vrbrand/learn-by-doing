**Highlight ****of activities for Bioengineering SEEF Fall 2017 - Fall 2018**

      

**Project 1   ****      BIOE.80/ENGR.80 ***Introduction to Bioengineering, *

** **Teaching team:** ** Prof. Drew Endy, and Prof. Jan Liphardt

* Complete course restructure

* Developed new material and activities for the course (Starting in Winter 2017).

* Created, for the first time, both pre-class and in-class material, including in-class active learning modules. 

* Served as a member of teaching team during Spring 2018.

**Key outcomes & Next steps ** In absence of a textbook creating the pre- and in-class material was the first step for upgrading the course with an eye towards sustainability.  Updated course reader and activities were well received by the students. 51% of the students reported the reading as very useful or extremely useful; anonymous feedback : "*Do the readings! The teaching team does their best to make them interesting and not textbook-like, and they help immensely in understanding the lectures.*" (45% reported the activities as very useful or extremely useful). For Spring of 2019, SEEF and the teaching team will update the course-reader and the activities, particularly upgrading the problem sets. 

**Project 2     ****_ BIOE.42 _***Physical Biology  *Instructor:  Prof. KC Huang

* Enhanced student learning via 2-stage problem sets. From syllabus: "*For each homework set, we will pass out the problem set [solution]... You will then have one week to write up another document that describes where you went wrong in every problem for which you lost points. This 'correction' will have a maximum value of half of the points that missed...The purpose of this is to allow you to reflect...*" 

* Added reading Chapter Quizzes each week to ensure student engagement 

* Participated as an observer and served as a guest lecturer. 

**Key outcomes & Next steps** ** **According to the TAs almost all students routinely took advantage of the 2-stage problems sets. Students highlighted the utility of the quizzes: "*This year there were some changes to the class ... adding in quizzes on reading. I thought the quizzes were great because they forced you to read the chapter, which really helped follow the lectures.*" For the Spring of 2019, SEEF and the teaching team plan to enhance student learning with scaffolded problems and activities. 

**Project 3     BIOE Core Curriculum Review **

With support and supervision of Undergraduate curriculum committee (UGCC) particularly 

Prof. Drew Endy and Dr. Ross Venook.

* Conducted a comprehensive review of the required core courses for the major.

    * Syllabus and course material review for each core course

    * Interviewed instructor(s), TA(s), and student(s) for each core course

* Developed student-facing (**Course Companion**) and an instructor-facing (**Curriculum Opportunities**) for each course, and overall department opportunities. 

    * Course Companion is a collection of tools to provide students with a description of learning objectives for each course.

    * Curriculum Opportunities is a collection of pedagogical approaches and suggestions selected for each course with an emphasis on curriculum cohesion. 

**Key outcome & Next steps ** Course Companions and Curriculum Opportunities will be shared online. Core classes have started to utilize components of the Course Companion. Within the department, the review has enabled us to plan for updating the curriculum and for leveling up courses with active learning approaches. Beyond campus, Dr. Venook has identified and connected with bioengineering instructors to share the document, which will enable us to seek and receive feedback from other educators in the field. 

**Project 4     BIOE.296  ***Educational Practice in Bioengineering*

* Develop and co-lead (ongoing during Fall quarter) a new activity-based course for the department teaching assistants.

* Course highlights pedagogy and evidence-based educational best practices focused on bioengineering courses. 

**Key outcome & Next steps **Student feedback will be collected mid-quarter with VPTL SGFS, and with an end of the quarter survey. Additional feedback will be collected from instructors leading courses that host the TAs. Based on this feedback, we will determine whether BIOE.296 should be offered yearly or quarterly.

**Project 5     BIOE.123 ***Biomedical System Prototyping Lab*

In collaboration with Dr. Ross Venook and Dr. Shima Salehi (Ph.D. student in Wieman group),

* Developed and co-led assessment and student interviews to determine student's ability to practice reflective problem solving approaches pre- and post-interventions. 

* Ongoing data analysis 

**Key outcome & Next steps **Team will upgrade and repeat the assessment activity as part of the Winter of 2019 to assess students' ability to practice reflective problem solving approaches.

**Mentorship & Support** The overarching goals for the projects were determined in conjunction with UGCC. To receive feedback and share progress, project updates were presented both during UGCC meetings (each quarter) as well as during the BIOE department faculty meetings.
